My name is Kai Ye, and I recently completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, advised by Dr. Liang Zhan. My research focuses on **brain neuroimaging, AI for healthcare, and trustworthy machine learning**.

My work has led to first-author publications at **AAAI** and **MICCAI**, including an AAAI **oral** presentation and a MICCAI **oral** presentation that received the **MICCAI STAR Award**. I have also collaborated with Prof. Paul M. Thompson and colleagues on multimodal brain MRI and interpretable models for neurodegenerative disease.

### Research interests

- Brain Neuroimaging (functional & structural MRI)
- AI for healthcare  
- Trustworthy machine learning  
- Multimodal representation learning

### Selected recent work

- **AAAI 2024 (oral)** – *Uncertainty Regularized Evidential Regression*  
- **MICCAI 2023 (oral, STAR Award)** – *Bidirectional Mapping with Contrastive Learning on Multimodal Neuroimaging Data*  
- Neural Networks 2024 – *BPEN: Brain Posterior Evidential Network for Trustworthy Brain Imaging Analysis*  

My CV is available on the [CV](/cv/) page.
